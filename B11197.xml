            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of great use and necessity to have now in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostle, and teacher of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Remember them, which have the rule over you, obey them, and submit your selves.</hi> Hebr. 13.7.17. <hi>and esteeme them very highly in love, for their works sake,</hi> 1. Thes. 5.13. And it is not without reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, they worke the worke of the Lord, and they watch for our sake, as they that must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. 1. Tim. 3.15. 1. Cor. 16.10. Heb.
<pb facs="tcp:176820:3"/>13.17. whose office is so honourable, that God himselfe not onely hath given a charge, that <hi>every man that will do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously, and will not bearken unto the Priest,</hi> the man shall be put away from Israel, but hath also severally this inobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency punished: <hi>The wrath of the Lord arose against his people,</hi> and gave them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the king of Chaldees, <hi>because they mocked the messenger of God, and despised his words,</hi> and misused his Prophets. Deut 17.12. 2. Chron. 36.16.</p>
            <p>Yet this is the contumacy and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of some boasters, and some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull men, which no otherwise, but as <hi>Jannes and Iambres</hi> withstood <hi>Moses,</hi> 2. Tim. 2.3. so they them, whom Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracle hath adjudged <hi>to be worthy of double honour:</hi> 1. Tim. 5.17. saying in effect to them as <hi>Korah</hi> did (with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the children of Israel, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Princes) to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; Ye take too much upon you,</hi> seeing all
<pb facs="tcp:176820:3"/>the congregation are holy every one of them: <hi>Wherefore then lift you up your selues above the congregation of the Lord?</hi> Num. 16.3.</p>
            <p>The experiment of these things gives every day our <hi>England,</hi> in the businesse of the Sabbatarians, who measuring themselves by themselves, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselves amongst themselves, even as in times past, the Scribes and Pharisees for a pretence make long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, devoure widows houses, Mat. 23.14. so they creep into houses, and in a shape of sanctimony (is it through the envy, or strife, or ignorance, I cannot tell) they cast a snare upon the silly consciences of men, making concision in the Church of the Lord, and so <hi>the middle wall of partition</hi> which Christ hath broken downe, Ephes. 2.14. they do renew, and this doing, shew themselves to be the deceitfull workers.</p>
            <p>Therefore to avoyd this confusion,
<pb facs="tcp:176820:4"/>we bring forth in the light this discourse penned for private satisfaction, and now approved to be printed for the publicke edification of the Church. Wherein the excellent Author seemes to have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them which have the Art to make Roses grow <hi>sine spinis,</hi> without a thorne, and yet be as faire and fragrant as any other: so that his Pedalean penne deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us a Theologicall decision of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths difficulties, <hi>sine spinosis &amp; paedagogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis argutiis;</hi> yet punctually to the minde of Christ, and the Church. Worthily therefore may it be presented to the Church of England, and to be accepted of thy favour.</p>

<list>
                     <item>1. That in Scripture, Antiquitie, and all Ecclesiasticall writers, it is constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appropriated to the Day of the Iews Sabbath, or Saturday, and not at all (till of late yeares) used to signifie our Lords-day, or Sunday.</item>
                     <item>2. That to call Sunday, by the name of the Sabbath-day <hi>(rebus sic stantibus)</hi> may for some respects be allowed in the Christian Church, without any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience: and that therefore Men (otherwise sober and moderate) ought not to be censured with too much seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor charged with Iudaisme, if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they so use it.</item>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:176820:7"/>

                        </gap>s, it were perhaps much more expedient, if the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> (in that notion) were either not at all, or more sparingly used.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>

<list>
                     <item>1. That it was taken up in memory of our Lord Christs Resurrection, and the great worke of our Redemption accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht therein.</item>
                     <item>2. That it hath warrant from the Scripture: (<hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.10.) and hath beene of long continued use in the Christian Church, to signifie the first Day of the weeke, or Sunday.</item>

<list>
                     <item>1. That it is taken from the course of the Planets, as the Names of the other Dayes are: the reason whereof is to be learned from Astronomers.</item>

                     <item> 2. That it hath beene long and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally used in most parts of the world.</item>
                     <item>3. That it is not justly chargeable with Heathenisme: and that it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from much weaknesse (at the least) if not rather superstition, that some men condemne the use of it, as prophane, heathenish, or unlawfull.</item>

               <p>That according to the generall matter or occasion of speech, each of the three may be fitter in some respects, and more proper to be used then either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Name <hi>Sabbath,</hi> when we speake of a time of Rest, indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and in generall, without reference to any particular Day.

               <p>But how farre forth, the words of the fourth Commandement are to be taken as a Law binding Christians, and by what authority they have that binding power, is the maine difficulty.</p>
               <p>For the resolution whereof, it may suffice every sober-minded Christian to understand the Prayer appointed by the Church, in that meaning which the words immediately import; and without over curious enquiry into those things which are more disputable, to beleeve these few points following, which ought to be taken as certaine, and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, amongst Christians: <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Touching which three opinions, I leave it to the judicious to consider,

                     <item>1 Whether the last of them might not happe to be of evill consequence, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in the power of every particular Church, at her pleasure to change the old proportion of one in seven (which hath continued ever since <hi>Moses</hi>) into any other greater or lesse proportion of time.</item>

                     <item>3 Whether a fourth opinion going in the middle way might not be proposde with greater probability, and entertain'd with better safety then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer three: <hi>viz.</hi> That the keeping holy of one day in seven, is of Divine Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Right; taking <hi>jus Divinum</hi> in a large signification, not for that which is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, properly, and directly such, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the second opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: but including withall, that which is secundarily, consequently, and analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically such.</item>

                     <item>1 That those things are <hi>de jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> in the first and strict sense, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176820:11"/>are enjoynd by the expresse ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and command of God in his holy word: or may be deduced therefrom, by necessarie, evident, and demonstrative Illation. In which sense, there are not very many things <hi>de Iure Divino,</hi> in the New Testament.</item>
                     <item>2 That for a thing to be <hi>de jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi> in the latter and larger sense, it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that it may be by humane discourse upon Reasons of congruity, probably deduced from the Word of God, as a thing most convenient to be observed by all such as desire unfainedly to order their wayes according to Gods holy will.</item>
                     <item>3 This kinde of <hi>jus Divinum</hi> may be reasonably discern'd by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all or the chiefest of these foure things following: <hi>viz.</hi>
